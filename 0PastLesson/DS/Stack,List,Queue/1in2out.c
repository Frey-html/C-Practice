/**********************************************************************************************************
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives 2 positive integers N and K (â‰¤10), 
which are the number of insertions and the number of queries, respectively. Then N distinct numbers are given 
in the next line, as the insertion sequence. Finally K lines follow, each contains N inserted numbers as the 
deletion sequence to be checked.
All the numbers in a line are separated by spaces.
